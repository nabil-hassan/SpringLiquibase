# SpringLiquibase
A very basic Spring Liquibase application skeleton, designed to show how to integrate and configure the two components, within the context of an MVC web application.

Uses H2 as an in-memory SQL data source, and Gradle for build management.

When the application is running, you can access a database console via the url: http://localhost:8091. 

Enter the URL as: "jdbc:h2:mem:public", and username and password as "sa", "sa", then click connect.
